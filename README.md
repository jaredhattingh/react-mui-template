### React/Material UI Frontend Skeleton with React Router, Recoil, and Auth0 implemented

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It includes react router, recoil (global state management), auth0 for authentication, and material ui (with theming setup).

##### To Get Started

In the project directory, first run `npm i` to install all node modules, then you add a .env file with your authentication settings.

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=
REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN=
REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=
REACT_APP_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://
```

Next, run:

##### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `npm run build`

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder (which you would then upload to a server to be hosted). It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
